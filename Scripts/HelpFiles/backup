      --help                  display this help file and exit
  -u                          when the backup script is called by another
                              script running as root, the $SUDO_USER becomes
                              "root" so the -u option with the actual username
                              as an argument is used to pass the username to
                              the backup script in other cases it's not
                              unnecessary

The default directory can be given in the ~/.volatizer/config file.
The backup directory should be on an entirely separate drive if possible for
the best chance of surviving a drive failure.
