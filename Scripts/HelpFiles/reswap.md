Usage: sudo volatizer-reswap
   or: sudo volatizer-reswap [swap_partition]

If your PC runs out of memory it uses swap to avoid freezing, but swap is not
cleared automatically as soon as there is enough memory available but this
slows down your system . Running this script will clear the swap for you.
Note that this script works with a single swap partition at the moment.
